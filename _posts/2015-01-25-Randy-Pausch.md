看了Randy Pausch教授的最后一堂课，能学习的东西太多了，记下来慢慢领悟。绝对值得一看。

- 我们不能决定人生拿到什么牌，但我们能决定如何打好手上的牌。
We cannot change the cards we are dealt, just how we play the hand.

- 任何事情都可能发生，我们不要忽略灵感和允许梦想的巨大力量。
Anything’s possible, and that’s something we should not lose sight of, is that the inspiration and the permission to dream is huge.

- 教练格雷厄姆说，好，那在一给定时刻有几个人触球? 其中之一。他说，对，所以我们要练其他 21 个人的任务。
Coach Graham said, all right, and how many people are touching the football at any given time? One of them. And he said, right, so we’re going to work on what those other twenty-one guys are doing.

- 当你搞砸了而没有人对你说任何东西，这意味着他们放弃了。
When you’re screwing up and nobody’s saying anything to you anymore, that means they gave up.

- 经验是在你无法获得想要之物后获得。
Experience is what you get when you didn’t get what you wanted.

- 在人生中的某些时刻，你会发现有些事情做不到，只要见到就很棒了。
At a certain point you just realize there are some things you are not going to do, so maybe you just want to stand close to the people.

- 但请记住，砖墙在那里是有原因的。砖墙不是要挡住我们。砖墙是要给我们机会说明我们有多迫切的想得到。因为砖墙是要阻挡那些不诚心的人，那些其他人。
But remember, the brick walls are there for a reason. The brick walls are not there to keep us out. The brick walls are there to give us a chance to show how badly we want something. Because the brick walls are there to stop the people who don’t want it badly enough. They’re there to stop the other people.

- 我说，对不起，你说你是汤姆.弗奈斯？他说是的。我说，那么我很愿意回答你的问题，但首先，你愿意明天一起跟我吃午饭吗？这个小插曲寓意很深，这里面有很多谦卑，但也让那人无法拒绝。
I said, then I would love to answer your question, but first, will you have lunch with me tomorrow? And there’s a lot in that little moment, there’s a lot of humility but also asking a person where he can’t possibly say no.

- 当你模仿聪明人时，看起来也蛮聪明的。
So it’s pretty easy to be smart when you’re parroting smart people.

- 他说，当你对别人怨恼愤怒时，你只是还没有给他们足够的时间。给他们多一点时间，他们将几乎总能让你叹服。
He said, when you’re pissed off at somebody and you’re angry at them, you just haven’t given them enough time. Just give them a little more time and they’ll almost always impress you.

- 他们两个人都在说，我不知道，但一个是很好的方式，一个坏的方式。
They’re both ways of saying I don’t know, but boy there’s a good way and a bad way.

- There was no rule!
（把一张漂亮的大图放在学术论文最前面。）

- 我对汤米说，你知道他们很可能不会拍下一部星战电影了。他说，不，他们会。
And I said to Tommy, you know they’re probably not going to make those next movies. And he said, no, THEY ARE.

- 安迪想了想，说，你明天到课堂，看着他们的眼睛说， "伙计，干得不错，但我知道你门能做得更好" 。这是至好的建议。因为他说的是，很显然你不知道标准要定多高，你主观的把标准定在哪儿对他们都不好。
And Andy thought for a minute and he said, you go back into class tomorrow and you look them in the eye and you say, “Guys, that was pretty good, but I know you can do better.” And that was exactly the right advice. Because what he said was, you obviously don’t know where the bar should be, and you’re only going to do them a disservice by putting it anywhere.

- 做一些别人没做过的事，你总会被暗箭袭击，你只能面对现实。我的意思是一切可能出问题的地方都出了问题。但回头看来，有很多人得到了很多乐趣。
 If you’re going to do anything that pioneering you will get those arrows in the back, and you just have to put up with it. I mean everything that could go wrong did go wrong. But at the end of the day, a whole lot of people had a whole lot of fun.

- 一个教育工作者能给的最好的礼物就是让人能自我反省。
 And that is the best gift an educator can give is to get somebody to become self reflective.

- 教别人东西的最好方法是让他们认为他们在学其它的东西。
 The best way to teach somebody something is to have them think they’re learning something else.

- 我跟我妈妈抱怨这考试有多难，有多可怕，她只是靠过来，拍拍我的胳膊说，我知道你的感受，小鬼，可记住你爸爸在你的年龄，正在和德国人打仗呢。
 And I was complaining to my mother about how hard this test was and how awful it was, and she just leaned over and she patted me on the arm and she said, we know how you feel honey, and remember when your father was your age he was fighting the Germans.

- 不要未失去好奇心，它太重要了，它驱动我们前行。
 Never lose the childlike wonder. It’s just too important. It’s what drives us.

- 因为我能。
Because I can.

- 她说，我花了很长时间但我最终搞明白了。跟男人谈恋爱实际上很简单。不理会他们说什么，只注意他们做什么。就那么容易。我回想起我的单身汉日子，我说，得。
Sil said, it took me a long time but I’ve finally figured it out. When it comes to men that are romantically interested in you, it’s really simple. Just ignore everything they say and only pay attention to what they do. It’s that simple. It’s that easy. And I thought back to my bachelor days and I said, damn.

- 有些改变人生的时刻，如果 10 年后，你回想起来，知道这些时刻，你就是有福的人。
There are moments that change your life. And ten years later if you know in retrospect it was one of those moments, you’re blessed.

- 当你做砸了，道歉。注意力在别人身上，而不是自己。
Apologize when you screw up and focus on other people, not on yourself.

- 我来解决。
I will fix this.

- 不要抱怨。而要加倍努力。
Don’t complain. Just work harder.

- 有一技之长，它使你有价值。
Be good at something, it makes you valuable.

- 有所准备。运气真的是机会与准备的结合。
And be prepared. Luck is truly where preparation meets opportunity.

- 这不是关于如何实现你们的梦想。它的关于如何引领你的生活。如果你正确引领你的生活，因缘自有报应。梦想会成真。
 It’s not about how to achieve your dreams. It’s about how to lead your life. If you lead your life the right way, the karma will take care of itself. The dreams will come to you.

- 你不能单打独斗，必须有人来帮你。只要你讲真话，就会有人来帮你。
You can't get there alone. People have to help you. You get people to help you by telling the truth.

- 诚以待人，这样别人也会忠实地对待你。
Loyalty is a two way street.
